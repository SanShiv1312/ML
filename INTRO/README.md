Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).
Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

### **How does ML work** 
A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives new data, predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.

### **Features of Machine Learning** :

- Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.
- It can learn from past data and improve automatically.
- It is a data-driven technology.
- Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.

 Machine learning is used in `self-driving cars`, `cyber fraud detection`, `face recognition`, and `friend suggestion` by Facebook and many more applications exist. 

 ### **Classification of Machine Learning** : 

 - Categories of machine learning problems, and terminologies used in the field of machine learning are 
    * **`Supervised learning`**
    * **`Unsupervised learning`**
    * **`Reinforcement learning`**
