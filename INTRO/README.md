Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).
Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

### **How does ML work** 
A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives new data, predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.

### **Features of Machine Learning** :

- Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.
- It can learn from past data and improve automatically.
- It is a data-driven technology.
- Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.

 Machine learning is used in `self-driving cars`, `cyber fraud detection`, `face recognition`, and `friend suggestion` by Facebook and many more applications exist. 

 ### **Classification of Machine Learning** : 

 - Categories of machine learning problems, and terminologies used in the field of machine learning are 
    * **`Supervised learning`**
    * **`Unsupervised learning`**
    * **`Reinforcement learning`**

#### `Supervised learning` : 
The way of providing some sample labeled data to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output. 
- The goal of Supervised learning is to map the input data with the output data 

Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data(training model) that is well labeled. After that, the machine is provided with a new unfamiliar set of data and now the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training model that is given previously and could be able to produce the desired output. 

- Supervised learning deals with teaching a machine with a `well-labled data set`, just like a teacher spoon feeds a student with simple examples ðŸ˜‰
